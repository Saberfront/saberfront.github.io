A few days ago there have been countless updates, from character creation to ToolStoreService updates. However, 
almost all of these updates use the newest API yet: SaberfrontDB

What is it?
-----------

SaberfrontDB is a service that powers the Force power, the starter pack timer, and ToolStoreService. ToolStoreService was initially using ROBLOX's data stores. However, the data stores proved ineffective, and they were abandoned as a result.Force powers were initially part of the main save in the data store. However, that had to be changed to accommodate the Force levels feature that allows players like you to customize the Force in their character. The starter pack timer was also part of a data store. However, the same thing happened to it, prompting the creator to move that system to SaberfrontDB.
