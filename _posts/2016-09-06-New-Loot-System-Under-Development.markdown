The original loot system has many flaws. However, by September 10th, a new face is about to emerge in the features list. Meet the Saberfront Rarity System! The rarity system is going to have 4 classes:

- Legendary
  - The rarest items around
  - usually in the form of apowerful blaster or just about any lightsaber type
  - chance must be 0.25 or below to get this and the other three weapons
- Rare
   - Not the rarest thing you'll find, but it is rarer than most items
   - usually a rare find such as junk items, medkits, and detonator packages.
- Uncommon
   - Rarer than the common item, it is not rare to find this item, but it is unusual to obtain one
   - Usually basic weapons such as the E-5 fall into this category
- Common

The Loot System is already implement in a test place right now. Here's the latest on the Item acquisition system:

- Basic loot system: DONE
- Chest system: YET TO BE FINISHED
- Pawn Value System: YET TO BE FINISHED
