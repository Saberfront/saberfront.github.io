The Mob Starfighters are currently under development. These mobs will feature a ship you can destroy, and a mob that sits and can be used to control the weapons system. The weapons system consists of three weapons : 

- Blaster bolts
  Blaster bolts are the neon red lasers that have  damage values to them.
- rockets 
- missiles

The Mob Starfighters will also feature a way to gain experience points for destroying the Mob that is positioned painstakingly inside the Starfighter with a script.
